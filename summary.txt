1 week (Feb 28 - March 6)

Intro

How does time impact length of ride?
- 4 histograms (weekday vs weekend)
  - X axis: hours of the day 0-23
  - Y axis: Miles or length in minutes
- Findings

How does time impact start/end locations
- Morning commute (6-10am)
  - Chord Graph from start locations to end locations (Cluster?)
  - Animated path + Heat (start locations)
- Evening commute (5-7pm)
  - Chord Graph from start locations to end locations (Cluster?)
  - Animated path + Heat (start locations)
- After work Travel (7pm-2am)
  - Chord Graph from start locations to end locations (Cluster?)
  - Animated path + Heat (start locations)
- Weekends
  - Chord Graph from start locations to end locations (Cluster?)
  - Animated path + Heat (start locations)
- Findings

Conclusion

Chord Graph Matrix
Each row is a group (station ID)
Row to column (1,2) -> from station 1 to station 2.
(2,1) -> from station 2 to station 1
Square Matrix in the end
